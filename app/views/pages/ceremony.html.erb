<h1>Ceremony</h1>
<p>Wendy Whiteley's 'Secret Garden' is nestled between Clark Park on Lavender Street and the Lavender Bay railway shunting yard.

This park used to be a derelict, unruly weed infested area that was used for railway dump for surplus trains and is leased by North Sydney Council from Railcorp so it can be enjoyed as a public space.   When one of Australia's most famous artists Brett Whitely died in 1992 the area was transformed by his widow Wendy into a tranquil lush enchanted haven that it is today as she channelled her grief into beautifying this land that has expansive views of Sydney Harbour.  

Within the park there are sculptures, herbs, Moreton Bay fig trees, romantic seating, and nature paths that criss cross or meet each other.  It appears to be a private garden but it is open to the public to enjoy. The park is an ode to a lost love and has been created for all to take a moment out of the daily grind to reflect.  It can also be hired for private functions, contact North Sydney Council to request a permit to use this area for your special occasion.</p>
